    <h2>How to make Jollof rice</h2>
    <p>Rinse the rice several times until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</p>
    <p>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and lower the heat to its lowest setting. Continue cooking, stirring often with a wooden spoon to avoid scorching, until the tomato paste begins to darken, 5 to 7 more minutes. Add the tomatoes and their juice and stir well to combine. Add the vegetable stock, bay leaf, fermented conch (“yett”) or fish sauce, salt, pepper, and Scotch bonnet. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the oil begins to rise to the surface, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in a steamer or couscoussier, add the uncooked rice, cover tightly, and steam for about 15 minutes. You’ll want to stir the rice once or twice to make sure it cooks evenly. (The rice is done when it is half cooked; the outer rim of each grain is translucent but it’s still crunchy to the taste.) Remove and stir to prevent clumping.</p>
    <p>Transfer the rice to the tomato broth. Stir and cover with a tight-fitting lid. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and cook until the grains are soft, about 30 minutes. Uncover and stir to release the steam and fluff the grains. Taste to see that the grains are cooked. If not, add a few drops of water, cover again, and continue cooking for a few more minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.</p>
