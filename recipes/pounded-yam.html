    <p>The making of pounded yam is rather straight forward</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>yam</li>
      <li>Thats it!!</li>
      <li>water...forgot about that one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The making</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Peel the yam and cut it into small cubes.</li>
      <li>Rinse about once or twice till you get clear water.</li>
      <li>Boil until the Yam becomes fork-tender.</li>
      <li>Pound or blend into a dough-like consistency until itâ€™s completely smooth with no yam chunks left.</li>
      <li>roll it into ball like shapes, or dinosaur shapes, whatever suits your fancy.</li>
      <li>that's it</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pounded yam is not consumed alone however, it is paired with some sort of stew. </h3>
    <p>the stew we'll be making is called Egusi</p>
