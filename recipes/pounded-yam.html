    <p>The making of pounded yam is rather straight forward</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>yam</li>
      <li>Thats it!!</li>
      <li>water...forgot about that one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The making</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Peel the yam and cut it into small cubes.</li>
      <li>Rinse about once or twice till you get clear water.</li>
      <li>Boil until the Yam becomes fork-tender.</li>
      <li>Pound or blend into a dough-like consistency until it’s completely smooth with no yam chunks left.</li>
      <li>roll it into ball like shapes, or dinosaur shapes, whatever suits your fancy.</li>
      <li>that's it</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Pounded yam is not consumed alone however, it is paired with some sort of stew. </h3>
    <p>the stew we'll be making is called Egusi</p>

    <h1>Egusi soup</h1>
    <img src="https://demandafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/EgusiSoup-e1533238405501.jpg">
    <p>its not actually a soup, don't let the name fool you, thats just what we call it</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup blended onions (about 3- 5 and fresh chilies, to taste)</li>
      <li>4 cups egusi (melon seeds, ground or milled)</li>
      <li>1⁄2 – 1 cup palm oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fresh Une (Iru, locust beans)</li>
      <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Ground crayfish (to taste)</li>
      <li>7– 8 cups stock</li>
      <li>Cooked Meat & fish (quantity and variety to personal preference)</li>
      <li>2 cups cut pumpkin leaves</li>
      <li>1 cup waterleaf (cut)</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons bitter leaf (washed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Make the soup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Blend egusi seeds and onion mixture. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, heat the palm oil on medium for a minute and then add the Une.</li>
      <li>Slowly add the stock and set on low heat to simmer.</li>
      <li>Scoop teaspoon size balls of the egusi paste mixture into the stock. Be sure to keep ball shape.</li>
      <li>Leave to simmer for 20 – 30 minutes so the balls cook through.</li>
      <li>Add the meat and fish and other bits which you’d like to use.</li>
      <li>Add cut-up pumpkin leaves. </li>
      <li>Add the waterleaf.</li>
      <li>Stir and put a lid on the pot and allow cook for 7–10 minutes, till the leaves wilt.</li>
      <li>Add the bitter leaf.  Leave the lid off while the cooking finishes for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir, check seasoning and adjust accordingly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Voilà, you're done, pair your pounded yam with the egusi soup and enjoy.</p>
